- **Scalability:** Horizontally scalable architecture using Kafka and microservices.
- **User Preferences:** Customizable alert radius and notification settings.
- **Security:** Secure authentication using JWT tokens with RBAC.
- **WebSockets:** Efficient real-time updates without page refreshes.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](path_to_architecture_diagram.png)

The system follows a microservices architecture, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Key components include:

- **Auth Service:** Manages authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- **Notification Service:** Consumes Kafka events and sends notifications based on user preferences.
- **User Service:** Manages user profiles and preferences.
- **WebSocket Service:** Handles real-time communication for live updates.
- **Eureka Server:** Service discovery for microservices.
- **API Gateway:** Centralized entry point for routing and managing incoming requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17:** The backbone of the application, leveraging modern Java features.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building robust and production-ready applications.
- **Kafka:** Messaging system for decoupling microservices and ensuring reliable event processing.
- **WebSockets:** Real-time communication for instant updates.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing user data and preferences.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestration for managing containerized applications at scale.
- **Eureka:** Service discovery for dynamic service registration.
- **API Gateway:** Handles routing, authentication, and load balancing for incoming requests.

## Microservices

### Auth Service

- **Purpose:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Technologies:** Spring Security, JWT.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/auth/login`
  - `/auth/register`
  - `/auth/refresh`

### Notification Service

- **Purpose:** Listens to Kafka topics and sends notifications based on user preferences.
- **Technologies:** Spring Kafka, Geolocation API.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/notifications/subscribe`
  - `/notifications/unsubscribe`


### User Service

- **Purpose:** Manages user profiles and preferences.
- **Technologies:** Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/users/{id}`
  - `/users/{id}/preferences`

### Eureka Server

- **Purpose:** Service discovery for dynamic registration of microservices.
- **Technologies:** Netflix Eureka.

### API Gateway

- **Purpose:** Centralized entry point for routing and managing incoming requests.
- **Technologies:** Spring Cloud Gateway.

## Scalability

The Neighborhood Alert System is designed with scalability in mind:

- **Kafka:** Ensures decoupled communication between microservices, allowing independent scaling.
- **Microservices:** Each service can be scaled independently based on load.
- **WebSockets:** Efficient handling of real-time updates to a large number of clients.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Simplifies deployment and scaling in a cloud environment.
- **Eureka:** Facilitates dynamic scaling by enabling services to find each other.
- **API Gateway:** Manages load balancing and routing to ensure efficient traffic handling.

## Design Patterns

- **Microservices:** Modular design promoting independence and scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic in the User Service.
- **Factory Pattern:** Used for creating complex objects in the Notification Service.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Implements various notification strategies based on user preferences.
